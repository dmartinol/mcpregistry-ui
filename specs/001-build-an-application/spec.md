# Feature Specification: ToolHive Registry Management Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that manages ToolHive Registries in a Kubernetes cluster. Registries are Created, Listed and Inspected. Registered servers are displayed and detailed. Deployed instances are monitored as well. Instances can be deployed from selected servers."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer managing ToolHive infrastructure, I need a centralized application to manage all ToolHive registries across my Kubernetes cluster. I want to create new registries, view all existing ones, inspect their configurations, browse available servers in each registry, deploy server instances to the cluster, and monitor the health and status of all deployed instances - all from a single, intuitive interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no existing registries, **When** I create a new ToolHive registry with name and configuration, **Then** the registry appears in the list and is accessible for server registration
2. **Given** multiple registries exist, **When** I view the registry list, **Then** I see all registries with their status, server count, and basic metadata
3. **Given** a selected registry, **When** I inspect its details, **Then** I see configuration, registered servers, and deployment history
4. **Given** a registry with available servers, **When** I select a server for deployment, **Then** I can configure deployment parameters and launch it to the cluster
5. **Given** deployed instances exist, **When** I view the monitoring dashboard, **Then** I see real-time status, resource usage, and health metrics for all instances
6. **Given** a deployed instance, **When** I view its details, **Then** I see logs, configuration, resource consumption, and deployment metadata

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a registry becomes unreachable or returns errors during listing?
- How does the system handle deployment failures or partial deployments?
- What occurs when monitoring data is unavailable or stale?
- How are registry conflicts or naming collisions managed?
- What happens when attempting to deploy to a cluster with insufficient resources?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new ToolHive registries with configurable parameters
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a comprehensive list of all managed registries with status indicators
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide detailed inspection capabilities for individual registries showing configuration and metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST enumerate and display all servers registered within each registry
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide detailed views of individual registered servers including capabilities and versions
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable deployment of selected servers as instances to the Kubernetes cluster
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time monitoring of all deployed instances showing health and resource metrics
- **FR-008**: System MUST track deployment history and instance lifecycle events
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle registry authentication and access control [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method for registries not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate deployment configurations before submission to prevent cluster errors
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide filtering and search capabilities across registries and servers
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle instance scaling operations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auto-scaling vs manual scaling requirements not specified]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support instance termination and cleanup operations
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist deployment configurations for reproducibility
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide audit logging for all management operations
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle multi-cluster deployments [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single cluster vs multi-cluster scope not specified]
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide alerting for instance failures or resource thresholds [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: alerting channels and thresholds not specified]

### Key Entities
- **Registry**: A ToolHive registry containing server definitions, with attributes like name, URL, authentication, and metadata
- **Server**: A registered tool/service definition within a registry, including capabilities, versions, and deployment requirements
- **Instance**: A deployed server running in the Kubernetes cluster, with runtime status, resource usage, and configuration
- **Deployment**: A deployment operation record linking server definitions to running instances, including parameters and history
- **Cluster**: The target Kubernetes environment where instances are deployed, with resource constraints and access credentials
- **MonitoringMetrics**: Real-time and historical data about instance performance, health, and resource consumption
