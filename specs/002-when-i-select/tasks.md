# Tasks: Registry Server Details View

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-when-i-select/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: TypeScript/React/Material-UI frontend + Express.js/Kubernetes backend
   → Structure: Web application with backend/ and frontend/ directories
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: RegistryServer, DeployedServer, RegistryDetail entities
   → contracts/: registry-details-api.yaml with 2 endpoints
   → research.md: Material-UI components, clipboard API decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: dependencies, linting configuration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, API endpoints, React components
   → Integration: API integration, navigation, state management
   → Polish: unit tests, performance validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness: All contracts tested, entities modeled, endpoints implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T003) before all other phases
- Tests (T004-T008) before implementation (T009-T026)
- T009-T011 (models) before T012-T013 (services)
- T012-T013 (services) before T014-T016 (endpoints)
- T017-T020 (components) can run parallel with backend tasks
- T021-T026 (integration) after core implementation
- T027-T035 (polish) after integration complete

## Parallel Example
```

Task: "Contract test GET /api/v1/registries/{registryId}/servers in backend/tests/contract/test_registry_servers_get.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/v1/registries/{registryId}/deployed-servers in backend/tests/contract/test_deployed_servers_get.test.ts"

Task: "TabNavigation component for Available/Deployed servers in frontend/src/components/TabNavigation.tsx"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Follow Material-UI design system patterns
- Maintain <200ms API response times
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - registry-details-api.yaml → 2 contract test tasks [P] (T004, T005)
   - Each endpoint → implementation task (T014, T015)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 3 entities → 3 model creation tasks [P] (T009-T011)
   - Services → service layer tasks (T012-T013)

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Navigation story → integration test (T006)
   - Available servers story → integration test (T007)
   - Deployed servers story → integration test (T008)
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation task (T034)

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Components → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004, T005)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T009-T011)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T004-T008 before T009+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Frontend/backend separation maintained
- [x] Material-UI and accessibility requirements included
- [x] Performance validation included (T031)
- [x] TDD approach enforced with failing tests first
