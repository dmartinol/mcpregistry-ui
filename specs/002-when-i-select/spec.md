# Feature Specification: Registry Server Details View

**Feature Branch**: `002-when-i-select`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "when I select a registry in the application I want to display its servers and also the deployed servers."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature request: Display server details when registry is selected
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: users
   ’ Actions: select registry, view servers
   ’ Data: registry servers, deployed servers
   ’ Constraints: selection-based navigation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are "servers" vs "deployed servers" distinguished?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific server information should be displayed?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: registry selection ’ server details view
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (registry, servers, deployments)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties - needs clarification on server types"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user managing ToolHive registries, when I select a specific registry from the registry list, I want to see detailed information about all servers associated with that registry, including both available servers and currently deployed servers, so that I can understand what's available and what's currently running.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing the registry list, **When** I click on a registry entry, **Then** I should see a detailed view showing all servers associated with that registry
2. **Given** I am viewing a registry's server details, **When** the page loads, **Then** I should see both available servers and deployed servers clearly distinguished
3. **Given** I am viewing a registry's server details, **When** there are no deployed servers, **Then** I should see an indication that no servers are currently deployed
4. **Given** I am viewing a registry's server details, **When** there are no available servers, **Then** I should see an indication that no servers are available in this registry

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a registry has servers but none are deployed?
- How does the system handle when a registry is empty (no servers defined)?
- What happens when deployment status is unknown or unavailable?
- How does the system behave when registry data is being synchronized?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a detailed view when a user selects a registry from the registry list
- **FR-002**: System MUST show all servers associated with the selected registry
- **FR-003**: System MUST distinguish between available servers and deployed servers [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes a "deployed server" vs an "available server"?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a way to navigate back to the registry list from the server details view
- **FR-005**: System MUST display server information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific server details should be shown - name, status, version, description, deployment target?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully when no servers are available or deployed
- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh server information when registry data changes
- **FR-008**: System MUST show deployment status for each server [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What deployment statuses are possible - running, stopped, pending, failed?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Registry**: Container for MCP servers, has name, status, server count, and associated servers
- **Available Server**: Server definition that exists in the registry but may or may not be deployed
- **Deployed Server**: Server instance that is currently running/deployed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where are servers deployed - Kubernetes, local machine, cloud service?]
- **Server Details**: Information about a server including [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: name, version, description, deployment status, configuration?]
