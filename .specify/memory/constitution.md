# MCP Registry UI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST follow test-driven development: tests written first, implementation second. Code MUST be maintainable with clear naming, proper documentation, and modular architecture. Static analysis tools MUST pass without warnings. Code reviews MUST verify adherence to style guides and architectural patterns.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces technical debt, improves maintainability, and ensures reliability in the MCP registry interface that developers depend on.

### II. Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is MANDATORY: unit tests for all business logic, integration tests for API contracts, end-to-end tests for critical user workflows. Test coverage MUST be above 90%. Tests MUST be deterministic and fast (<5s for unit tests, <30s for integration tests). Contract testing MUST validate MCP protocol compliance.

**Rationale**: The registry UI is a critical interface for MCP server discovery; comprehensive testing ensures reliability and protocol compliance.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All UI components MUST follow the established design system. User interactions MUST be predictable and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance). Loading states, error messages, and feedback MUST be consistent across all features. No feature ships without UX review and user testing validation.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load for developers browsing the registry and ensures accessibility for all users.

### IV. Performance Requirements
API responses MUST complete within 200ms (p95). UI interactions MUST feel responsive (<100ms feedback). Page loads MUST complete within 2 seconds on 3G networks. Memory usage MUST remain under 100MB for typical user sessions. Performance budgets MUST be monitored and enforced in CI/CD.

**Rationale**: Fast performance is essential for developer productivity when searching and discovering MCP servers.

### V. Security & Compliance
All user data MUST be encrypted in transit and at rest. Authentication MUST use secure protocols (OAuth 2.0/OIDC). Input validation MUST prevent injection attacks. Security headers MUST be properly configured. Regular security audits MUST be conducted and vulnerabilities addressed within 48 hours.

**Rationale**: Registry data and user information must be protected to maintain trust in the MCP ecosystem.

## Quality Standards

Code MUST pass all automated quality gates: linting (ruff/black for Python), type checking (mypy), security scanning (bandit), and dependency vulnerability checks. Documentation MUST be maintained for all public APIs and user-facing features. All changes MUST be peer-reviewed by at least one team member.

## Development Workflow

All features MUST follow the specification-driven development process: feature specification → planning → implementation → testing → deployment. Pull requests MUST include tests and pass all CI checks. Breaking changes MUST be documented with migration guides. Feature flags MUST be used for experimental functionality.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Any deviations MUST be explicitly justified in planning documentation and approved by the team. Constitution amendments require consensus approval and comprehensive impact analysis. All team members are responsible for enforcing these principles in code reviews and architectural decisions.
